This is an implementation of tripVote: complete a set of gene trees to maximize the quartet score
The core algorithm is the Maximum Triplet Rooting (MTR) problem:
    Root a tree T according to a reference tree R such that the triplet score of T and R is maximized.

The algorithm and the code heavily depend on the tqDist software http://birc.au.dk/software/tqDist/. 
We would like to thank the authors for the code and algorithmic ideas.

############### Build procedure: ############### 
First, install CMake https://cmake.org/download/

To build and install the library, clone the repo or download the zip file and unzip. Then execute the
following commands in a terminal:

```bash
cd <path to tripVote>/tqDist/
python setup.py install

cd <path to tripVote>/tripVote/
python setup.py install
```

Then you should be able to run the program. Type 

```bash
python tripVote_complete_trees.py -h```

to see the help message.
