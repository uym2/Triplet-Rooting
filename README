This is an implementation of triplet rooting algorithm: 
    Root a tree T according to a reference tree R such that the triplet score of T and R is maximized.
The algorithm and the code heavily depend on the tqDist software http://birc.au.dk/software/tqDist/. 
We would like to thank the authors for the code and algorithmic ideas.

############### Build procedure: ############### 

To build and install the library, unzip the directory and execute the
following commands in a terminal:

$ cd <path to library>/Triplet_rooting/
Triplet_rooting $ cmake .
Triplet_rooting $ make
Triplet_rooting $ make test

################ Executables ###################

## triplet_root
Usage: bin/triplet_root <refTree> <inTree> <outTree>

Where <refTree> and <inTree> point to two files each containing one
tree in Newick format. In both trees all leaves should be labeled and the
two trees should share some a majority of the leaf labels. <inTree> will be (re)rooted
such that its triplet score to <refTree> is maximized. The (re)rooted tree
will be written to <outTree>
The maximum triplet score between the two trees will be printed to stdout.

## delta_triplet_dist
Usage: bin/delta_triplet_dist <refTree> <inTree>

Where <refTree> and <inTree> are two trees in Newick format
In both trees all leaves should be labeled and the
two trees must have the same leaf set. Output:
 + The number of leaves in each tree
 + The triplet distance between the two trees
 + The minimum triplet distance of any rooting of <inTree> to <refTree>
 + The delta triplet distance
Note that the delta triplet distance is NOT symmetric.

## MVRoot
Usage: bin/MVRoot <inTree> <outTree>

Where <inTree> is a newick tree. The tree will be (re)rooted to minimize the 
root-to-tip variance and output to <outTree> file

## OGRoot
Usage: bin/OGRoot <inTree> <outTree> <outgroups>

Where <inTree> point to a file containing one tree in Newick format; 
<outTree> is the name of the output file; <outgroups> is a list of outgroup labels.
The tree will be (re)rooted at the biggest clade containing only outgroups.
