An implementation of triplet rooting algorithm: root a tree T according to a reference tree R such that the triplet score of T and R is maximized
The algorithm and the code heavily depend on the tqDist software http://birc.au.dk/software/tqDist/. We would like to thank the authors for the code and algorithmic ideas.
